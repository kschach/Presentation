## The Program Model

#VSLIDE

###The Problem

- Low-income community members face systemic barriers that prevent access to these entitlements (Shillington 2011).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Lack of access can have severe, negative impacts for those without adequate income prior to government transfers (social and financial exclusion, social determinants of health).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###The Remedy of Access to Benefits Programs
- Governments, civil society, and the private sector each have a role to play<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Non-profit organizations are well-positioned to support financially vulnerable community members<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

##Socioeconomic Justice
- What is socioeconomic justice?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How can it be attained?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE

###Fraser (1997)
- Injustice: socioeconomic and sociocultural<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Remedies: redistribution and recognition<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Strategies: affirmation and transformation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###Noonan (2012)
- Life-valuable materialist ethics<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "Life-value"<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Instrumental: resources and connections to sustain life<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Intrinsic: development and enjoyment of human capacities<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###Noonan (2012)
- Transformation from a system based on money-value to one based on life-value<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Life-valuable political practice in the here-and-now<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - “the struggle to build a new society is rooted in the life-valuable side of existing social institutions” (Noonan 2012:216)

#VSLIDE
###Implications
- Need to develop a nuanced perspective that recognizes:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Common socioeconomic injustice: poverty, lack of access to benefits<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Particular experiences vary with identity position / social location<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
- Which strategies are employed by non-profit access to benefits programs (affirmation / transformation)?
- Are access to benefits programs the most life-valuable alternative available to non-profits?<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

#VSLIDE
###Further Reading
- Delve deeper into Noonan (2012)<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- Open to other suggestions<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- But cautious to not get too immersed in theories of social justice / social change<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Socioeconomic Justice through the Welfare State
- Is the welfare state an effective lever for justice and life-value?<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- Is access to the current complement of welfare state benefits sufficient?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  

#VSLIDE
### Marshall (1949) - Social Citizenship
- Normative statement for social citizenship through the welfare state<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- "the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security" (1950:11)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live
the life of a civilised being according to the standards prevailing in the society" (1950:11)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Liberal Welfare State
- Does not grant and protect the rights of social citizenship<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Poor laws / principle of "less eligibility" (Piven and Cloward 1993:34-35)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Measures of last resort rather than rights<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Welfare State as Social Control (Piven and Cloward 1993)
- Welfare state function to regulate the supply of labour<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Expansion in response to political turmoil rather than social need<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Contraction once order and conditions for accumulation are restored<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Inequalities within the Welfare State
- Fiscal welfare vs. social welfare (Abramovitz 1983/2001; Titmuss 1965).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Social insurance vs. social assistance (Olsen 2002; Gordon 1994)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The latter are:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Less generous<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - More controlling<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Stigmatized in public discourse<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
## Axes of Inequality
- Gender (Gordon 1994; Piven and Cloward 1993; Abramovitz 1988; Morgen, Acker, and Weight 2009)
- 'Race' and ethnicity (Piven and Cloward 1993; Quadagno 1994)
- Indigeneity (MacDonald 2011)
- Citizenship status and duration of residency

## Summary
- Liberal welfare benefits ≠ social citizenship<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Benefits are insufficient to sustain life<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Social welfare benefits can subject recipients to disempowering and stigmatizing treatment<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Structural inequalities endure<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Implications
- Contribution of non-profit-mediated programs to social justice will vary according to:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - benefits accessed<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - demographic groups gaining access<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Potential for unintended harms resulting from inclusion as benefit recipients<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- If increased access is not enough, also need to work for more equitable redistribution
