## The Program Model

#VSLIDE

###The Problem
- A variety of welfare state benefits are targeted to residents living on low incomes.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Low-income community members face systemic barriers that prevent access to these entitlements (Shillington 2011).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Lack of access can have severe, negative impacts for those without adequate income prior to government transfers (social and financial exclusion, social determinants of health).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###The Remedy of Access to Benefits Programs
- Governments, civil society, and the private sector each have a role to play<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Non-profit organizations are well-positioned to support financially vulnerable community members<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###Access to Benefits Interventions
- Volunteer income tax preparation (CVITP, VITA)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Social assistance and social insurance advocacy<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Staff-driven access to benefits programs<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Individual casework<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Building system capacity<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Research Questions

- What is the theory of change underlying non-profit access to benefits programs?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- How can non-profit access to benefits programs contribute to socioeconomic justice?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Is government investment in non-profit access to benefits programs a sign of progress towards socioeconomic justice, or evidence of the offloading of public responsibility for social welfare?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#HSLIDE

## Key Concepts and Tensions

#VSLIDE

##Socioeconomic Justice
- What is socioeconomic justice?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How can it be attained?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE

###Fraser (1997)
- Injustice: socioeconomic and sociocultural<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Remedies: redistribution and recognition<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Strategies: affirmation and transformation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###Noonan (2012)
- Life-valuable materialist ethics<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "Life-value"<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Instrumental: resources and connections to sustain life<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Intrinsic: development and enjoyment of human capacities<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###Noonan (2012)
- Transformation from a system based on money-value to one based on life-value<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Life-valuable political practice in the here-and-now<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - “the struggle to build a new society is rooted in the life-valuable side of existing social institutions” (Noonan 2012:216)

#VSLIDE
###Implications
- Need to develop a nuanced perspective that recognizes:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Common socioeconomic injustice: poverty, lack of access to benefits<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Particular experiences vary with identity position / social location<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
- Which strategies are employed by non-profit access to benefits programs (affirmation / transformation)?
- Are access to benefits programs the most life-valuable alternative available to non-profits?<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

#VSLIDE
###Further Reading
- Delve deeper into Noonan (2012)<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- Open to other suggestions<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- But cautious to not get too immersed in theories of social justice / social change<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

#HSLIDE
## Socioeconomic Justice through the Welfare State
- Is the welfare state an effective lever for justice and life-value?<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- Is access to the current complement of welfare state benefits sufficient?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  

#VSLIDE
### Marshall (1949) - Social Citizenship
- Normative statement for social citizenship through the welfare state<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
- "the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security" (1950:11)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live
the life of a civilised being according to the standards prevailing in the society" (1950:11)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Liberal Welfare State
- Does not grant and protect the rights of social citizenship<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Poor laws / principle of "less eligibility" (Piven and Cloward 1993:34-35)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Measures of last resort rather than rights<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Welfare State as Social Control (Piven and Cloward 1993)
- Welfare state function to regulate the supply of labour<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Expansion in response to political turmoil rather than social need<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Contraction once order and conditions for accumulation are restored<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Inequalities within the Welfare State
- Fiscal welfare vs. social welfare (Abramovitz 1983/2001; Titmuss 1965).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Social insurance vs. social assistance (Olsen 2002; Gordon 1994)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The latter are:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Less generous<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - More controlling<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Stigmatized in public discourse<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Axes of Inequality
- Gender (Gordon 1994; Piven and Cloward 1993; Abramovitz 1988; Morgen, Acker, and Weigt 2009)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- 'Race' and ethnicity (Piven and Cloward 1993; Quadagno 1994)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Indigeneity (MacDonald 2011)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Citizenship status and duration of residency<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Summary
- Liberal welfare benefits ≠ social citizenship<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Benefits are insufficient to sustain life<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Social welfare benefits can subject recipients to disempowering and stigmatizing treatment<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Structural inequalities endure<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Implications
- Contribution of non-profit-mediated programs to social justice will vary according to:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - benefits accessed<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - demographic groups gaining access<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Potential for unintended harms resulting from inclusion as benefit recipients<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Implications
- If increased access is not enough, also need to work for more equitable redistribution
- What strategies could be effective in pushing the state to assume greater responsibility for social citizenship?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Is government and philanthropic investment in non-profit social service provision a promising strategy for increasing access to benefits by financially vulnerable community members?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What are the risks and drawbacks of this model?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Key Concepts
- "third-party government" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "hollow state" (Milward 1994)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "offloading" / "devolution"<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Potential Benefits
- Increased availability of social welfare programs and services<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Greater opportunities for local control and participation in social services<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Flexibility to adapt local conditions<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Drawbacks
- "philanthropic insufficiency" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Non-profit sector has marginal reach and capacity compared to the state<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Problems with securing funding without recourse to taxation (via government contracts, philanthropic funding, business activities, user fees)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Drawbacks
- "philanthropic paternalism" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - May need to tailor programs to match donor and government priorities rather than local needs<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "philanthropic particularism" (Salamon 1995)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - No universal mandate<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Can cater to particular demographics, specific geographic areas<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Shadow State (Wolch 1989:201)
*a para-state apparatus with collective service responsibilities previously shouldered by the public sector, administered outside democratic politics, but yet controlled in both formal and informal ways by the state.*<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Implications
- Potential benefits of investment in non-profit-mediated access to benefits programs:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - cross-sectoral partnerships that leverage the comparative advantages of each sector in service of a common good<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
###Implications
- Hazards of devolution:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Could result in reduction in the status of benefits: from entitlement to charitable aid (Wolch 1989; Roy 2004) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - "statization" (Wolch 1989:217) and "neoliberalization" (Woolford and Curran 2011:589) of civil society<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - "bureaucratic disentitlement" (Lipsky 1984)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#HSLIDE
## Prospective and Anticipated Outcomes

#VSLIDE
### Prospective Outcomes
- Access programs are regressive and antithetical to social justice.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Access programs contribute to individual affirmation and help service users improve their well-being<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Prospective Outcomes
- In addition to individual affirmation, access programs contribute to broader social transformation by empowering service users<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- In addition to individual affirmation, access programs contribute to social transformation by securing structural changes in the welfare system<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Accessibility<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Equity<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - Generosity<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#VSLIDE
### Anticipated Outcomes
- Non-profit-mediated access programs...
    - follow a strategy of affirmation.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - may the most life-valuable intervention strategy available to non-profits seeking to increase community members' incomes<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - lack the oppositional vision and strategy needed for fundamental transformation of the welfare state.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    - function as an "abeyance structure" (Taylor 1989:762)

#HSLIDE
## Limitations

#VSLIDE
- Insider position within the field<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Theoretical investigation rather than empirical evaluation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Examines strategies and processes rather than outcomes<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Not generalizable because of small, purposive sample, use of semi-structured interviews, and case study approach<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Service user voices are not included<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
