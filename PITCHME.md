## The Program Model

#VSLIDE

###The Problem
- A variety of welfare state benefits are targeted to residents living on low incomes.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Low-income community members face systemic barriers that prevent access to these entitlements (Shillington 2011).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Trend towards "bureaucratic disentitlement" (Lipsky 1984)
- Lack of access can have severe, negative impacts for those without adequate income prior to government transfers (social and financial exclusion, social determinants of health).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
